                <p>We help the development community to <strong>thrive</strong> by helping to get
                    <strong>deserving</strong> people to <strong>amazing</strong> events</p>
            </section>
            <p>
                Things happen in life, and you can't always give your career the love and care it deserves. We've all
                found an amazing conference or training course coming up just at the right time. There's bill to pay,
                and while you know that the amazing event you would love to go to is a solid investment in your future
                income, you just can't quite afford it right now.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Sustain</strong> can help.
            </p>

            <p>
                People in the development community are amazing. They are some of the
                most generous and incredible individuals in any walks of life, and believe it or not, they are happy to
                help YOU. Sometimes people have spare tickets, and they are delighted to donate a conference ticket to
                somebody they know will get good use out of it. Sometimes they are "paying it forward", they're giving
                someone else a leg up financially, because someone gave them a leg up in the past. And sometimes they
                are doing it out of the goodness of their hearts.
